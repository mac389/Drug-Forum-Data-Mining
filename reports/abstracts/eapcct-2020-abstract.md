Toxicology 2.0 – focus on Artificial Intelligence in medicine and toxicology, user forums in recreational drug toxicity, use of internet platform metrics as monitoring tools etc.

**Objective:** The Internet is a vast source of data on the effects and toxicity of recreational drug usage. The scope of Internet data exceeds human capacity to make sense of those data. Machine learning can identify patterns in large data sets, but the statistical relationships it identifies are difficult to explain in terms of accepted toxciological knowledge. The objective of our research is to develop artificial intelligence algorithms that combine the processing power of machine learning with the explanatory power of biomedical ontologies, another artificial intelligence technique. Here we present *psychoactive*, a platform that uses Markov logic to summarize usage of novel psychoactive substances as described on Internet forums.

**Methods:** We have shown that natural language processing of online forums can extract substance-substance and substance-effect comentions and that many of these comentions reflect patterns of coingestion and adverse effects reported in the literature [[1]](https://github.com/mac389/Drug-Forum-Data-Mining/blob/eapcct-2020/reports/abstracts/ref). We applied these algorithms to Lycaeum, an online forum devoted to emerging psychoactive substances to create a Markov logic representation of recreational drug use. We programmed this current version to answer three classes of questions: (1) Given mention of substance A, what other substances are also likely to be mentioned? (2) Given mention of effect A, what other effects are most likely to be mentioned?, and (3) Given mention of substance A, what effects are most likely to be mentioned?.  We developed an ontology, *sudo*, to standardize naming and describe the relationships between substances and effects in a systematic manner. Cliniciains, researchers, and the interested public can interact with this database via *psychoactive*, a web portal to the standardized database.

**Results:** Our database contains 636 unique substances and 33 effect classes. Of these 636, substances 257 had no more than a stub entry in PubChem or any chemical information database. Of the 201,930 possible substance-substance co-mentions, 13,604 co-occurred greater than would be expected by chance. Of these 13,604, 8,942 were previously described. Of the 20,988 substance-effect co-mentions, 346 co-occurred more frequently than would be expected by chance, 108 of which were previously described. Of the 1055 possible effect-effect co-mentions, 540 co-occurred more than would be expected by chance and 502 had been previously described. In all cases we computed the likelihood that the conditional probability between substances or effects was significantly greater than zero and then adjusted all p-values to a false discovery rate of 0.05 using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction.   

**Conclusion:** We present here *psychoactive* a user-friendly interface to a curated database of recreational drug usage and toxicity from online forums. The database contains novel and previously described substances and effects, lending validity to this approach to study known usage and toxicty and track emerging patterns. *Psychoactive* combines statistical and symbolic artificial intelligence to summarize patterns of use and is open source. This combination allows it to cross-reference effects and substances described online with formal peer-reviewed studies combining the strengths of both approaches to improving our understanding of recreation drug use and toxicity.
