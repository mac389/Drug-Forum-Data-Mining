Toxicology 2.0 â€“ focus on Artificial Intelligence in medicine and toxicology, user forums in recreational drug toxicity, use of internet platform metrics as monitoring tools etc.

**Objective:** The Internet is a vast source of data on the effects and toxicity of recreational drug usage. The scope of Internet data exceeds human capacity to make sense of those data. Machine learning can identify patterns in large data sets, but cannot explain or contextualize its findings in terms of accepted toxciological knowledge. The objective of our research is to develop artificial intelligence algorithms that leverage the processing power of machine learning with the explanatory power of biomedical ontologies, another artificial intelligence technique. Here we present *psychoactive*, a platform that uses Markov logic to summarize usage of novel psychoactive substances as described on Internet forums.

**Methods:** We have shown that natural language processing of online forums can extract substance-substance comentions and substance-effect associations that agree with patterns of coingestion and adverse effects reported in the literature [[1\]](https://github.com/mac389/Drug-Forum-Data-Mining/blob/eapcct-2020/reports/abstracts/ref). From this database of substance-effect and substance-substance comentions, we estimated the condition probabilities of one substance (or effect) mention given the mention of another substance (or affect). We developed an ontology, *sudo*, to standardize naming and describe the relationships between substances and effects in a systematic manner. We developed *psychoactive*, a web portal to the standardized database.

**Results:** Our database contains 636 unique substances and 33 effect classes. Of these substances 257 had no entry in PubChem. Of the 201,930 possible substance-substance co-mentions, 16,773 co-occurred greater than would be expected by chance, even after adjusting the false discovery rate to 0.05 by the Benjamini-Hochberg correction. Of these *Z* relationships, *Y* have never been reported. Of the 20, 988 substance-effect relationships, *H* were significance after adjusting the false discovery rate. Of the 528 possible effect-effect co-mentions, 875 were significant after adjusting the FDR.  Calculating the conditional probability lead to 



**Compress this presentation**. We expressed each coingestion, substance-effect occurrence, or effect-effect occurence as a logic statement whose probability of being true depending on the corresponding conditional probabilities. We creates *X* statements.

**Conclusion:** We present here *psychoactive* a user-friendly interface to a curated database of recreational drug usage and toxicity from online forums. The interface uses Markov logic to scale up human reasoning to rapidly generate hypotheses about mechanisms of toxicity and novel therapeutics.
